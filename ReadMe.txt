1) If species occurrences have to be downloaded (GBIF/Bioatles), a csv file with the exact names (no header) should be in the directory (e.g. 'species_bioatles.csv'). Otherwise, a csv with the records have to be available (e.g. 'sp_records_bioatles.csv')

2) Modify 'minba_00settings.r' setting all the parameters depending on the case study you want to run, if environmental data has to be downloaded, etc

3) Run 'minba_run_new.R'
